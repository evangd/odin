All of my projects completed as part of The Odin Project.

To anybody reading: I am already familiar with most of the material covered in the Foundations course, but I am doing The Odin Project anyways in order to pick up a few new things that I might not have learned yet about the basics of web development, as well as to start learning Node.js from the JavaScript course.
