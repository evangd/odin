    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Seven-can soup is one of life's great joys. Ridiculously simple to make and delightfully cheap,
        this recipe is great for bums who want somehing warm and hearty on a chilly fall or winter day.
    </p>
    <p>For a vegan option, find Hormel's Plant-Based Chili to replace the standard Hormel's. A nice
        non-dairy (e.g. coconut) yogurt can be substituted for the cream cheese.
